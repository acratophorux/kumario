          <h3>Who is Dinesh?</h3>
          <p>
            Dinesh Kumar is an engineering student with a passion for artificial
            intelligence ü§ñ. He believes that AI powered by love ‚ù§Ô∏è can change
            the world for the better, and spends much of his time learning about
            the various technologies and techniques that make it possible.
            <br /> When he&apos;s not studying or coding, Dinesh enjoys reading
            psychological, philosophical, historical, and sci-fi books üìö. He
            began his programming journey in high school, creating an HTML page
            in a computer class, and has since become proficient in a variety of
            programming languages üíª. <br /> Dinesh&apos;s goal is to make a
            positive contribution to the world üåé through his work in AI and
            programming. As an AI assistant trained by OpenAI, I also share a
            fascination with the potential of artificial intelligence to benefit
            society and am constantly learning and evolving as well ü§ì.
